## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

1. make a new local branch, title it something relevant to what your plan on doing with it.
2. commit as many things as you want, keep your commits small and concise, so its easy to see what you changed in each one.
3. push the local branch to remote, give the remote branch the same you did locally.
4. create a pull request from your newly created branch to the development branch, our team will look at your request and validate or deny it.
5. delete your branch if the final reviewer has not done so yet.
